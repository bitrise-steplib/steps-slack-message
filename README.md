# Send a Slack message

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-io/steps-slack-message?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-slack-message/releases)

Send a [Slack](https://slack.com/) message to a channel or group.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>


Send a [Slack](https://slack.com/) message to a Slack user, a group, or a channel. Create and customize the messages however you see fit. Among other things, you can:

- Set a different text for failed and successful builds.
- Add an icon and/or emojis to your messages. 
- Set the bot user's name for the messages.
- Linkify channel names and usernames.
- Add and customize attachments. 

### Configuring the Step 

To use this Step, you need either a configured Slack Integration in your workspace, an incoming Slack webhook or a Slack bot user with an API token. For the former see your Workspace settings, for the latter two, you can set them up in Slack:

- [Incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).
- [Bot user with an API token](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).

Once you're ready with those, come back to Bitrise and configure the Step itself:

1. Create a [Secret Env Var](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/) for either your Slack webhook URL or your Slack API token.
1. Add the Secret to either the **Slack Webhook URL** or the **Slack API token** input.
1. Toggle the **Run if previous Step failed** option on - you should see a white checkmark on green background next to it. This allows Slack messages to be sent for failed builds, too.
1. In the **Target Slack channel, group or username**, set where the Slack message should be sent. 
1. Customize your messages as you'd like. For the details, see the respective inputs.


In case of the Slack Integration usecase you can copy the ID in your Workspace settings, on the Integrations page. This ID is not senstive, you can use it as a step input as-is, or put it into a regular environment variable.

Note that this step always sends a message (either to `channel` or `channel_on_error`). If your use case is to send a message only on success or on failure, then you can [run the entire step conditionally](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/steps-and-workflows/introduction-to-steps/enabling-or-disabling-a-step-conditionally.html).

### Troubleshooting 

If the Step fails, check your Slack settings, the incoming webhook or the API token, and your Slack channel permissions.

## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).

### Examples

#### Using OAuth integration (recommended)

First, set up the integration between your Bitrise Workspace and your Slack instance. Go to Bitrise _Workspace Settings > Integrations_, select _Slack_, then follow the instructions.

Once the two services are connected, copy the integration ID (under the `...` menu) and pass it as an input to this step. This ID is not senstive, you can use it as a step input as-is, or put it into a regular environment variable.

```yaml
steps:
- slack:
    title: Notify team
    inputs:
    - workspace_slack_integration_id: example
    - message: This is a test notification, please ignore
    - emoji: ":bitrise:"
```

#### Using webhooks

To register an Incoming WebHook integration visit: https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks.

```yaml
steps:
- slack:
    title: Notify team
    inputs:
    - webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - message: This is a test notification, please ignore
    - emoji: ":bitrise:"
```

#### Using Block Kit

Please check the format guideline [https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#arg_blocks](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#arg_blocks)

```yaml
steps:
- slack:
    title: Notify team
    inputs:
    - workspace_slack_integration_id: example
    - message: This is a test notification, please ignore
    - blocks: |-
            [
                {
                    "type": "section",
                    "text": {
                        "type": "plain_text",
                        "text": "Hello world"
                    }
                }
            ]

```
