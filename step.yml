title: Send a Slack message
summary: Send a [Slack](https://slack.com/) message to a channel or group.
description: |-
  
  Send a [Slack](https://slack.com/) message to a Slack user, a group, or a channel. Create and customize the messages however you see fit. Among other things, you can:
  
  - Set a different text for failed and successful builds.
  - Add an icon and/or emojis to your messages. 
  - Set the bot user's name for the messages.
  - Linkify channel names and usernames.
  - Add and customize attachments. 
  
  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  To use this Step, you need either an incoming Slack webhook or a Slack bot user with an API token. You can set up both on your Slack account:
  
  - [Incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).
  - [Bot user with an API token](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).
  
  Once you're ready with those, come back to Bitrise and configure the Step itself.
  
  1. Create a [Secret Env Var](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/) for either your Slack webhook URL or your Slack API token.
  1. Add the Secret to either the **Slack Webhook URL** or the **Slack API token** input.
  1. Toggle the **Run if previous Step failed** option on - you should see a white checkmark on green background next to it. This allows Slack messages to be sent for failed builds, too.
  1. In the **Target Slack channel, group or username**, set where the Slack message should be sent. 
  1. Customize your messages as you'd like. For the details, see the respective inputs.
  
  Note that this step always sends a message (either to `channel` or `channel_on_error`). If your use case is to send a message only on success or on failure, then you can [run the entire step conditionally](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/steps-and-workflows/introduction-to-steps/enabling-or-disabling-a-step-conditionally.html).
  
  ### Troubleshooting 
  
  If the Step fails, check your Slack settings, the incoming webhook or the API token, and your Slack channel permissions.
